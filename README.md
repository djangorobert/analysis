A Django Pandas data app

Technologys used:
1.)Django
2.)Pandas
3.)CSS


The Goal of this Project was to use the Popular Python package Pandas Data Analysis Package with a Django Web App to read data from a CSV file(excel file). 
This task is important since many companys now days have data on csv files, the good thing is Pythons Panda package can make this easy to read the file
and to use analysis techniques. 

This Project I took all the Citys in the State of New Mexico and used pandas to filter out the data. Here is a sample.
